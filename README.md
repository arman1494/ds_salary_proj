## Collect the data


The data for fetching information from [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm) was obtained through the Glassdoor website itself, which can be accessed at Glassdoor. To interact with the website and retrieve the data, the Selenium framework was used.

If you're interested in learning how to fetch data from Glassdoor using Selenium, I recommend checking out the following article: [Selenium Tutorial: Scraping Glassdoor.com in 10 Minutes](https://mersakarya.medium.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905). 
This tutorial provides a practical guide on how to scrape data from Glassdoor using Selenium.

Additionally, you can find the corresponding code and implementation details in the GitHub repository available at [link](https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium). This repository contains the necessary code and resources to help you get started with scraping Glassdoor using Selenium.
